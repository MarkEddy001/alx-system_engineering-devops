## Project Overview
This project, initiated on Nov 29, 2023, delves into networking basics with a focus on the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, UDP and TCP protocols, and TCP/UDP ports. It culminates with a practical task involving the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) for network connectivity assessment.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you are expected to master the following concepts:
- OSI Model
- Types of Networks (LAN, WAN, Internet)
- MAC and IP Addresses
- UDP and TCP Protocols
- TCP/UDP Ports
- ICMP and Network Connectivity

## Tasks
### 0. OSI Model
- What is the OSI model?
- How is the OSI model organized?

### 1. Types of Network
- Identifying the type of network based on scenarios.

### 2. MAC and IP Address
- Understanding MAC and IP addresses.

### 3. UDP and TCP
- Clarifying the characteristics of UDP and TCP protocols.

### 4. TCP and UDP Ports
- Creating a Bash script to display listening ports.

### 5. Is the Host on the Network
- Implementing a Bash script to ping an IP address and assess network connectivity.

## Requirements
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Bash script files must be executable
- README.md file is mandatory
- Scripts must pass shellcheck without errors

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the specific directory for each task.
3. Execute the Bash scripts using the specified commands.

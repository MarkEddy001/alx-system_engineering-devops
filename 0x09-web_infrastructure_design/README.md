# Tasks

## Single Server Web Infrastructure (www.foobar.com)

### Overview
This document outlines the design and specifications for a one-server web infrastructure hosting the website www.foobar.com. The infrastructure includes a single server with a LAMP stack, comprising a web server (Nginx), an application server, and a MySQL database. The domain www.foobar.com is configured with a www record pointing to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

### Components and Roles
1. **Server:**
   - Definition: A physical or virtual machine that hosts the entire web infrastructure.
   - Role: Hosts the web server, application server, and database.

2. **Domain Name:**
   - Role: Serves as a human-readable alias for the server's IP address, allowing users to access the website using www.foobar.com.

3. **Web Server (Nginx):**
   - Role: Handles incoming HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

4. **Application Server:**
   - Role: Executes the application code and generates dynamic content for client requests.

5. **Database (MySQL):**
   - Role: Stores and retrieves data for the application, ensuring data persistence.

6. **www DNS Record:**
   - Type: CNAME
   - Role: Specifies that www.foobar.com is an alias (canonical name) for the domain's root.

### Issues with Single Server Infrastructure
1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
   - Risk: If the single server fails, the entire infrastructure becomes unavailable.
   - Mitigation: Consider implementing redundancy or failover mechanisms.

2. **Downtime During Maintenance:**
   - Issue: Restarting the web server for maintenance causes downtime.
   - Mitigation: Implement rolling deployments or use a backup server during maintenance.

3. **Scalability Limitations:**
   - Issue: Unable to handle high traffic as the infrastructure cannot scale horizontally.
   - Mitigation: Consider load balancing and distributed architectures.

## Three Server Web Infrastructure (www.foobar.com)

### Overview
This section expands the infrastructure to three servers, introducing redundancy and scalability through the addition of a load balancer (HAproxy).

### Additional Components and Roles
1. **Load Balancer (HAproxy):**
   - Role: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving performance and reliability.

2. **Distribution Algorithm:**
   - Algorithm: Round Robin
   - Explanation: The load balancer distributes requests equally among the available servers, ensuring a balanced load.

3. **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:**
   - Setup: Active-Active
   - Explanation: All servers actively handle incoming requests, providing high availability and load distribution.

4. **Database Primary-Replica Cluster:**
   - Role: Provides data redundancy and read scalability.
   - Explanation: The primary node accepts write operations, while replica nodes handle read operations.

5. **Primary vs. Replica Nodes:**
   - Application Interaction: The application interacts with the primary node for write operations and replica nodes for read operations.

### Issues with Three Server Infrastructure
1. **Single Points of Failure:**
   - Load Balancer: A single load balancer is a potential SPOF.
   - Mitigation: Consider load balancer redundancy or a high-availability setup.

2. **Security Issues:**
   - Lack of Firewall: Absence of a firewall poses security risks.
   - No HTTPS: Insecure communication jeopardizes data integrity.
   - No Monitoring: Insufficient visibility into system health and performance.

## Secured, Encrypted, and Monitored Three Server Web Infrastructure

### Overview
This section enhances the three-server infrastructure with security measures, SSL encryption, and monitoring components.

### Additional Components and Roles
1. **Firewalls:**
   - Role: Act as barriers between the server and potential threats, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.

2. **SSL Certificate:**
   - Role: Encrypts traffic between the user and the server, ensuring secure data transmission.

3. **Monitoring Clients (Sumologic):**
   - Role: Collects and analyzes system and application metrics for proactive issue identification.

### Secure and Monitored Infrastructure Specifics
1. **Traffic over HTTPS:**
   - Reason: HTTPS encrypts data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and ensuring data integrity.

2. **Firewalls:**
   - Purpose: Protects against unauthorized access and potential attacks.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Purpose: Proactively identifies issues, monitors performance, and ensures system health.

4. **Monitoring Tool (Sumologic):**
   - Data Collection: Collects logs and metrics from servers, applications, and databases.
   - Monitoring QPS: Set up custom queries to monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second).

### Issues with Secured and Monitored Infrastructure
1. **SSL Termination at Load Balancer Level:**
   - Issue: Decrypting SSL at the load balancer exposes traffic within the internal network.
   - Mitigation: Implement end-to-end SSL encryption.

2. **Single MySQL Server for Writes:**
   - Issue: Limits write scalability and poses a potential SPOF.
   - Mitigation: Implement a MySQL cluster for write scalability and redundancy.

3. **Identical Server Components:**
   - Issue: Uniform components across servers pose a risk if a common vulnerability affects all instances simultaneously.
   - Mitigation: Implement diverse configurations and patch management strategies.

## Application Server vs. Web Server

### Overview
This section introduces a cluster configuration for load balancing and redundancy.

### Additional Components and Roles
1. **Load Balancer (HAproxy):**
   - Configuration: Clustered with another load balancer for redundancy.
   - Role: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.

2. **Split Components:**
   - Web Server, Application Server, Database on Separate Servers.

### Clustered Load Balancer Specifics
1. **Clustered Load Balancer:**
   - Reason: Ensures high availability and fault tolerance for load balancing.

2. **Split Components:**
   - Reason: Isolates components for better resource management, scalability, and maintenance.

### Issues with Clustered Load Balancer and Split Components
1. **Load Balancer Cluster:**
   - Issue: Configuration synchronization challenges between load balancer nodes.
   - Mitigation: Implement proper configuration management tools.

2. **Web Server, Application Server, Database Uniformity:**
   - Issue: Identical configurations may lead to simultaneous vulnerabilities.
   - Mitigation: Implement diverse configurations and regular security audits.
